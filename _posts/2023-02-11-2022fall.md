This **fall semester of 2022** was a memorable one for me. I put my full focus into classes such as **System Programming,** **Digital Systems Design and Experiments,** and **Internet Security** and was able to achieve great results. In this post, I want to take an overview of what I have learned in each subject and record my experiences during this semester.

## System Programming

In **System Programming**, I learned about the general overview of computer systems by reading **CS:APP**. Through this class, I studied the following topics:

- **Machine-Level Programming**
    - Assembly Basics
    - x86-64 Linux Memory Layout & How program uses stack for calling procedures
    - Buffer Overflow Attack and Mitigations for the attack (Stack Canary, ASLR, NX, â€¦)
    - **Assignments: bomblab(Reverse Engineering using gdb) & attacklab(Exploiting programs using BOF)**
- Basics of Compiler Optimization (Constant Folding, Loop Unrolling, Code Motionâ€¦)
- Memory Hierarchy
- **Linking**
    - ELF object files
    - Loading Executable Object Files
    - Static Linking & Dynamic Linking
    - Position-Independent Code (PIC)
- Exceptional Control Flow
    - Exception & Exception handler, Signals
    - Process Control (`fork`, `wait`, `exec`, â€¦)
    - **Assignments: shlab(Wrote my own Unix shell), dbglab(Wrote my own debugger with breakpoint feature)**
- **Virtual Memory**
    - Overview of Virtual Memory
    - Dynamic Memory Allocation
    - **Assignment: malloclab(Wrote my own memory allocator using segregated free lists)**
- System Level I/O, File System
- Network Programming
- **Concurrent Programming**
    - Multithreading, Semaphore, Mutex
    - Race, Deadlock, Livelock, Starvation
    - Thread-safe & Async-signal-safe
    - **Assignment: proxylab(Wrote my own web proxy)**

## **Digital Systems Design and Experiments**

In **Digital Systems Design and Experiments**, I learned Verilog to design a practical digital system, and various digital modules such as Adders, Multipliers, Counters. Through this class, I learned following topics:

- **Verilog**
- Designing Digital Systems
    - ASICs, FPGAs, â€¦
    - Static Timing Analysis
- Number Representations
    - 1â€™s Complement, 2â€™s Complement, RNS, MRS, â€¦
    - Floating-Point Arithmetic
- Adders
    - RCA, CLA, Carry Select Adder, Carry Skip Adder, Carry Save Adder, Parallel Counters, â€¦
- Multiplication
    - Boothâ€™s Algorithm
- **Labs & Term Project - Implementing a CNN Accelerator**
    - Term project was to implement a **CNN Accelerator** using **Systolic Array** on the **FPGA** board in team.
    - I designed a **pooling module** that performs the computation in pooling layer in CNN, and modules that uses **APB protocol** to communicate with host CPU from FPGA board.
    - I also participated in debugging a **FC module** and **Conv module**.
    - Although our every modules did success to **pass the simulation test**, we couldnâ€™t upload the program on FPGA board, because of the error in Conv module. ðŸ¥² (Pooling module & FC module worked well when uploaded on the board.)

## Internet Security

In **Internet Security**, I learned various topics about internet security such as **Cryptography**, **Blockchain**, **Web security**.

- Cryptography
    - Symmetric key cryptography
    - Public key cryptography - RSA, ElGamal algorithm, ECCâ€¦
    - Digital Signatures, MAC
- PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
- Blockchain
- Web & Network Security
    - TCP/IP Architecture, HTTPS
    - DDoS Attacks
    - Firewall, IDS
    - Cookie, SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF

## **Conclusion**

Overall, I am very pleased with the results I have achieved this semester. My hard work has paid off, and I have earned an **A+** in all of the classes I took this semester. ðŸ˜Š

My fall semester of 2022 was a fruitful one that allowed me to gain insight and knowledge in a variety of different topics. Through the classes I took, I was able to learn about computer systems, digital systems design, internet security, and more. I am grateful for the experience I had and look forward to continuing to learn and grow.
