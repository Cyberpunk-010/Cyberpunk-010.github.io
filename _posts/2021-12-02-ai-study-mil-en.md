&nbsp;In November, I participated in [2021 Customized AI Education for Military](https://military.elice.io/). I'm writing this post to record what I've learned during this month.

## 🏃‍♂️ Beginning

</p>

&nbsp;In October, after learning lots of things by participating in [OSAM Hackathon]({{site.url}}/hackathon/osam-hackathon), I was having a break creating my own blog, and writing review post for the hackathon. In the meantime, I happened to see the poster of **2021 Customized AI Education for Military**.   
&nbsp;Since OSAM Hackathon was such a good experience for me, it was very nice to see that there was another educational content provided to soldiers for free. Also, I liked the fact that I could study AI, a field I had a strong interest in. So I decided to participate in the education on the day I saw the poster.

## 👶 Customized Education

</p>

&nbsp;2021 Customized AI Education for Military was providing **customized education** by offering beginner, intermediate, advanced course. Since I was still unfamiliar with python and had little background knowledge about AI, I was assigned to beginner course after taking the test.

## 📚 Studying Using Github

</p>

&nbsp;To review what I've learned from lectures, I started writing summary and uploading it to github. I created a repository named [```AI_study_mil```](https://github.com/cw00h/AI_study_mil), and uploaded my summaries on it.

&nbsp;Since it was the first time for me writing Markdown document, uploading summaries on github was kind of big challenge for me. After trying many different ways, I found out that I could write pretty neat summaries using ```Jupyter Notebook``` by writing down theoretical contents and codes together. I liked the fact that I could organize summaries by chapter, and that the time I studied each chapter was recorded in a committed time.

## 🔥 From Beginner Course To Advanced Course

</p>

&nbsp;As I checked my progress during the education, it looked like i would be able to take every lectures in beginner, intermediate, and advanced courses before the education ends. Since it is not common to take such good lectures for free, I focused on military artificial intelligence education for a month with the goal of taking all lectures. From November 1st, I participated in education almost every day, and I posted what I studied on my repository. You can see how I stuided by checking my commit records and Alice's code execution records. As a result of taking education for a month, I was able to take all lectures up to advanced courses. 

## 🤖 What I learned

</p>

&nbsp;In the beginner course, I learned basic ways to use **python libraries** like ```Numpy```, ```pandas```, ```Matplotlib```. You can check my summaries in [```data_analysis_basic```](https://github.com/cw00h/AI_study_mil/tree/main/data_analysis_basic), and [```data_analysis_practice```](https://github.com/cw00h/AI_study_mil/tree/main/data_analysis_practice).   

&nbsp;In the intermediate course, I studied various **Machine Learning** approaches. I learned about large approaches like Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and detailed machine learning techniques like classification, regression. You can check my summaries in [```machine_learning```](https://github.com/cw00h/AI_study_mil/tree/main/machine_learning).

&nbsp;In the advanced course, I learned basic concepts of **deep learning**, and various concepts about natural language processing like **Word Embedding**, **Language Model**, and **Document Similarity**. You can check my summaries in [```deep_learning_basic```](https://github.com/cw00h/AI_study_mil/tree/main/deep_learning_basic), [```natural_language_processing```](https://github.com/cw00h/AI_study_mil/tree/main/natural_language_processing).
