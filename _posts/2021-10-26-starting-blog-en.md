# 🥳 Starting my blog

April 13, **my birthday**, is now also **the birthday of my own blog**.   
I thought a lot about what I should write on the first posting of the blog that I've worked hard on, and I finally decided to post about **my plans and thoughts** at the start of this blog.

<!-- ## ✨ Why I started blogging

I decided to start the blog for three main reasons:

### 👦 To express myself to others

&nbsp; First of all, I wanted to show others **what I've done** and **who I am** effectively using the blog.   

&nbsp; This August, I participated in **2021 Military Open Source Online Hackathon** organized by [OSAM](https://osam.kr). During the team building period, I applied to several teams and received some reply mails, one of which was **"Is there any website or portfolio where we can see your works?"**.

</p>

&nbsp;Since I've never participated in any hackathon, and I haven't organized projects that I've done, I **couldn't answer properly** to the mail. Only after receiving this mail, I realized that people take a look into applicant's portfolio when looking for a team member(...). I was upset that **I couldn't express what I've done** properly to others even if I have worked so hard. So I decided to start my own blog to show what I've done to others effectively.   
&nbsp;This blog will be used to **record what I've done**, and show others **what I can do** effectively.

### 🤝 To share information

&nbsp;I have received so much help from the Internet. Now, I wanted to help others through blogs and pay off the debt to the Internet. 

&nbsp;I started studying about Frontend web development for the first time to participate in the hackathon. While studying many topics like HTML, CSS, JS, React, Redux, I could get as much information as I wanted **for free**. The questions people exchanged in [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com) also helped me a lot.   
&nbsp;I thought that the way to **repay** those who gave me information was to use it well and grow up, and then **share what I learned with others** just like them. Since I thought that starting a blog was the most easiest way to share information, I decided to start my own blog.   
&nbsp;From now on, I'm going to organize what I've learned and post it so that it can help others.

### ✍ To organize my thoughts

&nbsp;**Writing** is difficult. It takes a long time to think, a lot of effort. This process is difficult, but you can get **valuable learning**. I want to **write regularly** and **learn** by blogging.

&nbsp;I think I'm not a deep thinker. I just write what comes to mind when I write a diary, and sometimes I give up on thinking just saying *I don't know~ It will be fine~ 🙄*. However, when writing something that others will read, I get to **think more deeply** than usual to show better writing to readers. To show better writing, I have the process of refining tangled thoughts to explain my thoughts well enough for others to easily understand. Also, when I write some posts sharing information that I know, I will go through the process of **knowing more clearly what I know**.   
&nbsp;I thought I would be able to have this experience of organizing my thoughts often if I started my blog.

## 🌐 Running a bilingual blog

&nbsp;All posts on this blog will be written **in Korean and English**, respectively. It won't be easy, but following two reasons made me to decide like this.

### 🙌 Beyond the limit of langauges
&nbsp;I didn't want to make a **limit** of my blog using only Korean. 

&nbsp;If I ran my blog only in Korean, my blog would get a clear limit. To people who can't speak Korean, my blog will be left as **a page written in Alien languages 👽** , and I wouldn't be able to **communicate** with people who can't speak Korean.   
&nbsp;However, If a run my blog in two languages, even though I have to work harder, my posts can reach to much more people, and I would be able to **help much more people**. I thought **the possibility of helping more people around the world** was more valuable than the effort in writing in English, so I decided to write a blog in English too.

### 🔥 To study English
&nbsp;**English is hard..** I can read documents in English pretty well, but it is still hard for me to write or speak in English. I thought writing posts in English on my blog would make me get to be **friendlier with English** .    
&nbsp;Writing a blog in English would help more people in world, and **improve my English skills**, so there was no reason for me to run my blog only in Korean.

## 🎉 What's next?
&nbsp;Thinking about writing on the blog in the future is already full of excitement! I'm going to organize what I learned, and upload the projects I participated in on this blog. 🤗 -->
